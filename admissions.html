</ol>
<h2>Parent Co-Operation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Parents are expected to support and reinforce the school rules and policies. The school expects parents to attend parent-teacher meetings, school functions and thus show their interest in their student's school activities.</li>
<li>Parents, guardians or other persons are not allowed to speak to the students or their teachers during class hours / during transition without the permission of the Principal. Appointments may &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be made before hand to interact during a teacher's free period, with the approval of the Principal.</li>
<li>Private tuitions are strongly discouraged. If there is a real need, written permission is required from the Principal to engage a tutor at home. School Teachers are not ordinarily allowed to give tuitions to pupils who are being taught by them and parents are requested to strictly refrain from engaging the school teachers for their ward's private tuition.</li>
<li>Parents are expected to co-operate in the work of the school by enforcing regularity and discipline and by taking general interest in the child's progress.</li>
<li>Parents are expected to encourage the students to speak in English. Parents should take keen interest and initiative for the academic development and fluency in English of their wards so as to maintain the school's standard.</li>
<li>The school will insist on strict punctuality, regular school attendance, cleanliness in dress, general grooming and fidelity to study and work assignments. Absence from school for merely social functions will be strongly discouraged.</li>
<li>Students who neglect their lessons will be required to stay in school after class to complete their lessons.</li>
<li>Attendance at school functions such as Children's Day, Teacher's Day, Sports Day, etc. is very essential.</li>
<li>Parents or guardians are specially requested to notify the school of any change in their address or telephone numbers.</li>
<li>When communicating with the Principal, parents are requested to mention in their letters the standard, name, roll number and division in which their children are studying.</li>
